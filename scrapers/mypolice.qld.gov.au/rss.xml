<p><em>Police are appealing for dash cam footage as they continue the search for a five-year-old girl who was reported missing from Nielsens Road at Nerang around 4.30pm yesterday.</em></p>
<p><em>Motorists with dash cam footage, who may have been driving in the vicinity of Nielsens Road anytime from 4pm yesterday, are asked to review their vision to see if it contains any information which may assist police with their investigations.</em></p>
<p><em>She is described as Caucasian in appearance, around 115 centimetres tall with blonde, shoulder-length hair.</em></p>
<p><em>She was last seen wearing a pink t-shirt with a lady bird emblem on the front, dark blue denim shorts and no shoes.</em></p>
<p><em>If anyone does locate vision police ask that the footage be downloaded to a USB and delivered to the nearest police station or the Command Post at the 7 Eleven on Nielsens Road.</em></p>
<p><em>At the current time police have enough volunteers to conduct the search but the public can assist by rechecking backyards and surrounding areas.</em></p>
<p><em>Call 131 564 if you see her or to provide any other information you think police should know.</em></p>
<p><em>Call Triple Zero (000) to provide life threatening information about this incident.</em></p>

<p><em>The Queensland Police Service is continuing to seek urgent public assistance to help locate five-year-old girl who was reported missing from Nielsens Road at Nerang around 4.30pm yesterday.</em></p>
<p><em>Police are being joined by State Emergency Service volunteers and members of the public to search for her around the Nerang and Carrara areas.</em></p>
<p><em>She is described as Caucasian in appearance, around 115 centimetres tall with blonde, shoulder-length hair.</em></p>
<p><em>She was last seen wearing a pink t-shirt with a lady bird emblem on the front, dark blue denim shorts and no shoes.</em></p>
<p><em>Residents living in the area between Alexander Drive, Hinkler Drive, Explorer Way and surrounds are asked to check their yards, sheds, pools and other hiding spots for the girl.</em></p>
<p><em>People who have already checked their homes and yards are asked to check again – particularly any areas where a child may curl up, have a sleep or hide.</em></p>
<p><em>People searching for her are encouraged to call out her name.</em></p>
<p><em>If you locate her, do not approach her as she suffers from a medical condition and may not react as expected.</em></p>
<p><em>Call 131 564 if you see her or to provide any other information you think police should know.</em></p>
<p><em>Call Triple Zero (000) to provide life threatening information about this incident.</em></p>
<p><em>If members of the public wish to join the search, they should attend the 7 Eleven on Nielsens Road so that their efforts can be properly coordinated.</em></p>
<p><em>Approximately 160 police and SES personnel are currently involved in the search including members of the Gold Coast Rapid Action and Patrol Group, plain clothes officers, the Mounted Unit, Water Police as well as officers from Brisbane.</em></p>
<p><em>The New South Wales Police Force has offered the QPS assistance if required, but this generous offer has not yet been taken up.</em></p>
